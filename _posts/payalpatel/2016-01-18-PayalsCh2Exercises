Reflection:
These three exercises helped me learn more about print statements, inputs, different variable types (such as int, float, and string).  I found these exercises helped me practice the different ways these tools can be used.  While working on these exercises I had some difficulty with the print statement, however, after looking at [this website] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14041791/print-variable-and-a-string-in-python) I was able to figure out how to print what I wanted (in the format I wanted) using Python.
